# Cadence SRAM Design

This repository contains the design and simulation of a low power synchronous random access memory (SRAM) using 6T cells, developed in Cadence Virtuoso.

## Overview

The project focuses on creating an efficient memory design with an emphasis on low power consumption. It leverages the 6T cell structure—a popular choice for static RAM—to achieve the desired performance. The design includes comprehensive schematics and simulation files to validate functionality and performance.

## Key Features

- **6T SRAM Cell**: Implementation of the standard 6-transistor memory cell.
- **Low Power Consumption**: Optimized for reduced power usage during read and write operations.
- **Synchronous Operation**: Designed with synchronous control to ensure proper timing.
- **Cadence Virtuoso**: Developed and simulated using Cadence Virtuoso tools.

## Repository Structure

- **/schematics**: Contains the circuit schematics of the SRAM design.
- **/simulations**: Includes simulation scripts, testbenches, and related files to verify the design.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sumit-2020/cadence_sram.git
   ```
2. **Open in Cadence Virtuoso:**
   - Load the schematics and design files from the folder.
   - Review and run simulation files located in the folder.
3. **Explore Documentation:**
   - Additional details and analysis can be found in the github repo and on Cadence Website.

## Requirements

- **Cadence Virtuoso**: Essential for viewing and simulating the circuit designs.
- **Supported CMOS Process Libraries**: Ensure you have access to the libraries compatible with your design environment.
